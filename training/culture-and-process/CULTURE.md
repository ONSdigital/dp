Culture in DP
===========================

Our culture and how we work is important for us to create an inclusive, empathetic and successful environment that works for everybody. 

### Principles

#### Inclusion
We believe people from different backgrounds, with different identities and experiences, make our product, and our team, better. 

We know a happy, comfortable and safe environment where our people are free to express themselves and their ideas means we create the best experiences for our users. 

#### User first
We put out users at the heart of everything we do. This includes external and internal users. We know our users come from everywhere with a range of expertise and needs which helps to create a better product for all.

We follow [GDS design principles](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#start-with-user-needs). 

#### Open communication and collaboration
We code in the open. This means most of our code is publicly available on Github and it hosts a lot of our coding discussions. When reviewing code we should we keep our comments constructive, helpful and kind.

We encourage as many conversations and calls as possible to happen in open slack channels so that they are inclusive to all and can act as a source of information in the future. To let others know you're concentrating on a task or that you'd like to minimise distractions use the headphones emoji ðŸŽ§ .


Whichever platform we use to communicate we always try use open and inclusive language, but we know mishaps and slips occur. If they do happen, we encourage open and respectful discussions around what sort of language is preferable, with the intent to learn from our mistakes.

#### Self care
We believe in everyone being happy and well and we know that everyone has different personal needs, circumstances and responsibilities. This means healthy and flexible working patterns, and being mindful of others' availability when scheduling events and communicating.

We encourage a healthy work life balance and as a team discuss our work load openly, especially when it feels too much.

#### It's fine to say "I don't know"
No one knows everything and we don't expect you to. It's fine to say you don't know something when asked. When you don't know something it's fine to ask questions and for help. You might not be alone in not understanding something so asking questions to the wider team in meetings or open channels can often help everyone.

#### No blame
We know mistakes and errors happen but instead of placing blame we encourage the reporting of them and take an active approach to learning from them when they happen. Our aim is to learn and prevent the same or similar mistakes in future, not to punish or judge anyone involved.
