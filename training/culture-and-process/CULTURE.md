Culture in DP
===========================
Our culture and how we work is important for us to create an inclusive, empathetic and successful environment that works for everybody. 


### Principles

#### Inclusion
We believe people from different backgrounds, with different identities and experiences, make our product, and our team, better. 

We know a happy, comfortable and safe environment where our people are free to express themselves and their ideas means we create the best experiences for our users. 

#### User first
We put out users at the heart of everything we do. This includes external and internal users. We know our users come from everywhere with a range of expertise and needs which helps to create a better product for all. 

We follow [GDS design principles](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#start-with-user-needs). 

#### Open communication and collaboration
We code in the open. This means most of our code is publicly available on Github and it hosts a lot of our coding discussions.

We encourage as many conversations and calls as possible to happen in open slack channels so that they are inclusive to all and can act of a source of information in the future.

#### It's fine to say "i don't know"
No one knows everything and we don't expect you to. It's fine to say you don't know something when asked. When you don't know something it's fine to ask questions and for help.

#### No blame
We know mistakes and errors happen but instead of placing blame we encourage the reporting of them and take an active approach to learning from them when they happen.
