### What is Digital Publishing?

This is guide that aims to give an overview of the Digital Publishing department - what it is, and what it does.

To understand what Digital Publishing is, it is important to understand how it sits within the wider organisational framework. 

### UKSA

Digital Publishing is part of the Office for National Statistics, which is part of the UK Statistics Authority (UKSA).

The UKSA is an independent body, which has a statutory objective of promoting and safeguarding the production and publication of official statistics that ‘serve the public good’. 

The public good includes:
- informing the public about social and economic matters
- assisting in the development and evaluation of public policy
- regulating quality and publicly challenging the misuse of statistics

The collective goal of the official statistics system is to mobilise the power of data to help Britain make better decisions.

The UKSA consists of three principal areas:
- the Government Statistical Service (GSS), which is the cross-government community of all those involved in the production of official statistics in the UK
- the Office for National Statistics (ONS) which is the executive office of the UK Statistics Authority and the largest producer of official statistics in the UK
- the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR) which is the regulatory arm of the UK Statistics Authority. It assesses official statistics for compliance with the Code of Practice for Statistics, reports on system-wide issues and on how statistics are used, celebrating when the standards are upheld and challenging publicly when they are not.

### Digital Publishing

Digital Publishing is the arm of the ONS whose primary focus is on providing content through digital means. The main areas of operation involve the ONS website, API, developer site, content management system, social media, digital and print design, data visualisation, content and editorial work, and various other “digital” and “publishing” things.

The main aims of Digital Publishing can be summarised as the following:

- Continuously improve the user experience of our website, including how we publish open data
- Improve the ONS Website
- Future proof the organisation’s digital publishing capability
- Develop new digital products that extend the impact of our data and analysis
- Support publishing operations and policy
- Understand our online communities to make sure we are driven by user needs
- Measure the impact of our online presence

Digital Publishing is made up of a number of different departments and sub-departments. The three main areas that these departments cover are: Publishing and Content, Development, and Insight.

## Publishing and Content

The Publishing and Content area covers content design and publishing operations. This includes a team of publishing officers and content editors, who are responsible for the timely and accurate dissemination of official statistics, and helping to develop and maintain digital and content standards.

Content design is a multi-disciplinary team of data journalists, data visualisation specialists, design and social media experts whose primary goal is to produce content for the ONS.

## Development

The Development area focuses mainly on the software development aspect of Digital Publishing, with software teams working on a range of projects, from improving and advancing existing products, through to creating new systems and tools that will transform how the organisation works. 

Work within this department generally involves the ONS website, content management systems, and publishing platforms. More specific focus can be on the API and backend, which is responsible for our public-facing APIs, our developer site, and our backend publishing systems. Additional focus is on our data import and export pipelines, and working with statistical teams to migrate their data, and also exploring ideas we may take through to production in the future.

Development areas also include Dev Ops, Interaction Design, and Data Delivery. 


## Insight

Insight covers the user research, analytics, and business analyst aspects of Digital Publishing.
