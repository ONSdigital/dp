Cloud Services and Infrastructure in Digital Publishing
===========================

We use Amazon Web Services in Digital Publishing to host all of our services, as well as our Continuous Integration (CI).

You should be given relevant AWS accounts by your manager or a Tech Lead - speak to your manager if this does not happen soon upon starting with the team. 


Introduction to our Infrastructure
----------------------------

In your first few weeks you should be invited to a number of 'Intro Workshops', one of which will be on the topic of Infrastructure. 

### Pre reading

- Make sure you're familiar with basic AWS terms: 
    -  [Availability Zones and Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/) 
    - VPCs and Subnets are also good to understand at a basic level

### Materials

The workshop will walk through [these slides (WIP)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VQjYd6R6xDRluA_fTF4teu97umJam2y--XlewZjeBrU/edit?usp=sharing) over roughly 1 hour, with time for questions.



Advanced Infrastructure
----------------------------

To understand AWS concepts such as VPC, Subnets and Security Groups in more detail, some members of our team have found [this pluralsight course](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/aws-networking-deep-dive-vpc) very useful.
