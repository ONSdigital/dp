Web & Publishing Journeys
===========================

The core function of Digital Publishing is to provide a means to prepare, publish and disseminate statistical outputs and analysis content. This requires a Content Management System, used by ONS staff to prepare publications, and a public website for users to access our content. Understanding the services underpinning these journeys is crucial to understanding the service we build and support.

### Pre-reading

For wider context on where Digital Publishing fits in to government statistical production, you may wish to [read this module](culture-and-process/DIGITAL_PUBLISHING.md) first.

### Prerequisites

Explore [ONS.gov.uk](ONS.gov.uk) a bit to get a sense of the kind of information on our website, and ask a member of the team to give you a brief demo of Florence - our content management system. This may help give you some context as we explain the services and architecture that allow all of that to work.

### Materials

[This presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tYEmddv2icKKmFkrSTMbiMPUE53pbbRA/edit#slide=id.p1) introduces the principles underpinning the way the website was originally constructed, highlighting some core service names and areas we're looking to move beyond. It will explain terms like 'zebedee', 'florence', 'the train', 'babbage' and 'files on disk'.

### Next steps

To understand how we're moving from these core services to a more maintainable approach, refer to the slides in our [Microservice training](../architecture/MICROSERVICES.md).
