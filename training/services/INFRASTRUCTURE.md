Cloud Services and Infrastructure in Digital Publishing
===========================

We use Amazon Web Services (AWS) in Digital Publishing to host all of our services, as well as our Continuous Integration (CI).

### Pre reading

- Make sure you're familiar with basic AWS terms: 
    -  [Availability Zones and Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/) 
    - VPCs and Subnets are also good to understand at a basic level

### Pre requisite

You should be given relevant AWS accounts by your manager or a Tech Lead - speak to your manager if this does not happen soon upon starting with the team. 

### Materials

The workshop will walk through [these slides (WIP)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VQjYd6R6xDRluA_fTF4teu97umJam2y--XlewZjeBrU/edit?usp=sharing) over roughly 1 hour, with time for questions.

### Next steps

To understand AWS concepts such as VPC, Subnets and Security Groups in more detail, some members of our team have found [this pluralsight course](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/aws-networking-deep-dive-vpc) very useful.
