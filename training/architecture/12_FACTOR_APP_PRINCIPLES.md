12 Factor App Principles
===========================

In Digital Publishing we build, deploy and manage applications which run as services. The twelve-factor methodology helps us follow best practices and build applications which are portable and resilient. This module will introduce you to the Twelve-factor principles and provide you with examples of how we use them in our team.

## Pre requisites


## Materials

### 1. **Codebase**
We create one GitHub repository per application, for example the [dp-bulletin-api](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-bulletin-api) repository contains our codebase for that app. 
Whenever we _deploy_ the dp-bulletin-api, we use a version of the code in the dp-bulletin-api repository. The `production` environment will contain a version deployed from the `master` or `main` branch of the repository, which may be different from the `develop` branch.
