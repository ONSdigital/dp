API Architecture
===========================

Module description - why its relevant in our context

### Pre-reading

Understand our [microservice](MICROSERVICES.md) approach

### Materials

[This presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1K7NN-oPn427Xc339s6NL3vbfNGPC62y3euhvRapwFf8/edit#slide=id.p) gives a basic introduction to what our API service is providing, why we care to make our APIs public and how we break down our microservices when it comes to API development. It also outlines some initial plans for API development required for Census work.

Our [API standards](../../standards/API_STANDARDS.md) are also an important read to understand the full context needed to begin API development in our context.
