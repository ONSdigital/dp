Unit Testing in Golang
===========================

Unit testing is the process of testing a portion of an application or service to ensure it meets our requirements.

Ideally unit should only test the portion of the application we are focused on, and shouldn't connect with other parts of the system.  This can be difficult, and so sometimes different portions of the system are 'mocked', which is covered in this article.
