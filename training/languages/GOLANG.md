Introduction to Golang
=======================
Go (sometimes called Golang), is a general-purpose programming language that was developed by Google. The main purpose of Go was to make it faster and easier for developers to develop applications. It has modern features like garbage collection and it also takes advantage of powerful multi-core computer capabilities with built-in concurrency support. It is easy to learn, easy to read, highly efficient, scalable and is also backed by a robust standard library which makes it easy to write code that is readable and maintainable. The appeal of Go’s features and speed has drawn interest by many different types of developers including: application developers and infrastructure teams. Many big names like Docker, Kubernetes, etc are built using Go.

## Pre-reading (Advantages of Go)
Go brings a whole set of advantages as it combines the best features of other programming languages. Go’s thorough concurrency support, simplicity and memory allocation make it easy to see why we use Go to build our applications. There are some familiar advantages of Go which are listed in [this](https://golangbot.com/golang-tutorial-part-1-introduction-and-installation/) article and to complete the list a few other can be added too which is listed [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/here-are-some-amazing-advantages-of-go-that-you-dont-hear-much-about-1af99de3b23a/) and is worth reading too.

### 1. Golang exercises
A simple hands-on [Introduction to Go](https://gobyexample.com/) using annotated example programs gives you a list of key essentials to start with. To practice Go with the help of excercises [Go Exercises](https://golangr.com/exercises/#GoPractice) will get you started. These exercises will help you with Go training and provides an option to download answers when stuck. It caters for both beginners and intermediate users.

### 2. Golang - Best practices
If you are looking for Go best practices and wanted to discover some tips and tricks to optimise your work, [Golang Best Practices](https://golangdocs.com/golang-best-practices) is a good place to start. Using the best coding practices not only improves code quality but also makes the code much more understandable, flexible, reusable and maintainable.

### 3. Gotchas in Golang
 If you took the time to learn the language reading the official spec, wiki, mailing list discussions, source code, etc this information may seem obvious but a quick glance at [50 Shades of Go](http://devs.cloudimmunity.com/gotchas-and-common-mistakes-in-go-golang/index.html) will save you hours debugging your code.
