Training in Digital Publishing
===========================

:warning: **This section is very much a work in progress. Links may not resolve, and content linked to may be unfinished** 

When joining Digital Publishing, there can be a lot to learn! We want to give you the benefit of all our previous learning, so we've tried to gather it in one place.

We have collected resources that give you an idea of [structured learning](#onboarding-workshops) you'll be undertaking over your first few weeks as well as [training materials](#further-training-areas) the team have found useful over the years.

If you come across a resource that really helped you understand some technology we use, or how we work, please do add a link to it in the relevant document or start a new doc if the topic is not yet covered.
