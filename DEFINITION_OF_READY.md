Definition of ready
==================

Defines what we expect from a user story before it goes into a sprint planning session.

### Before sprint planning

* User research
* Analysis
* Prototypes
* Story in backlog
* Prioritised
* Complexity score (S/M/L)
* 'L' stories broken down

### For sprint planning

* Acceptance criteria
* Context - including user needs (where possible)
* Requirements not solutions

## Example story

_**Note**: Stories don't need to be in this format, but must include: Who, What and Why_

As DP I want to have a link to the annual survey on the ONS website so that we can gather feedback

* Must be easy to hide/remove
* Follows UX design
