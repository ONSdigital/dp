Definition of ready
==================

Defines what we expect to be available to feed into a user story before it goes into a sprint planning session.

### Before sprint planning

* Agreed capabilities (Dev, BA, QA, PO)
* User research
* Analysis
* UX design work
* Evidence feedback method(s)
* Story in backlog
* Business priority (BA, PO)
* Technical priority (Dev)
* External dependencies identified & resolved
* Complexity score (S/M/L*)
  * 'L' stories broken down

### For sprint planning

* Acceptance criteria
* Context - including user needs (where possible)
* Requirements not solutions

## Example story

_**Note**: Stories don't need to be in this format, but must include: Who, What and Why_

As DP I want to have a link to the annual survey on the ONS website so that we can gather feedback

* Must be easy to hide/remove
* Follows UX design
