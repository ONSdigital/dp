## Git account and configuration

We use Github for hosting all of our code, so you'll need a Github account. You may use and existing account or setup one specific to ONS if you like.

1. Create a [github account](https://github.com/) if you dont already have one
2. Send your username to a Tech Lead who will add you to the [ONSdigital](https://github.com/ONSdigital) organization.
3. Ensure you've [set up Multi Factor Authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/configuring-two-factor-authentication) on your Github account
4. Configure git locally by running the following commands:
    * git config --global user.name <YOUR_NAME>
    * git config --global user.email <YOUR_EMAIL_IN_GITHUB>
