Developer environment options
=================

We've made a few attempts at simplifying the way we run our microservices locally, but haven't converged on one way of doing things yet. A few options are explored in this guide.

## iTerm2 setup

- Any terminal can be used however there are advantages of using iTerm2 such as badges, profiles, arrangements, multiple panes, ability to send commands to all panes.
- [Install iterm2](https://www.iterm2.com/)
- [Setup the pane arrangements and profiles](https://blog.andrewray.me/how-to-create-custom-iterm2-window-arrangments/)
- Optional: [Give each profile a badge](https://www.iterm2.com/documentation-badges.html)

## Useful resource

- [dp-cli](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-cli) is a useful tool to grant access to environments and SSH into them when working offsite as well as other tasks
